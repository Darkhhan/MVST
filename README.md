# **2. Project description** 

## **Purpose and benefits in the real world:**  
   Our project is to create a website where people can find movies to their liking during their holidays and have a good time. The problem is that nowadays there are a lot of movies being shot and it becomes difficult for us to find something worthy among all this. We offer movies that are in our personal tops.
## **Scope of the project:**  
   Our team can complete this project completely and fulfill all the goals and solve problems.
## **Type of the user-interface:**  
   We have chosen the web user-interface as it is the easiest way to connect this interface with the **Oracle** database server.
## **Programming language and database server:**  
   We will link the selected database server (**Oracle**) using the **PHP** programming language. The choice was **PHP** because in this language it is also easy to connect our Web interface and the database server.

## **Dataset for the project**  
  
The idea in our project is that the admins add movies that they like. For this reason, we did not import data, but created our own.
It is impossible to export CSV files from the Oracle server, so we exported a pdf file and json file, it is stored in the **"data"** folder.
