# **Project description** 

## **Purpose and benefits in the real world:**  
   Our project is to create a website where people can find movies to their liking during their holidays and have a good time. The problem is that nowadays there are a lot of movies being shot and it becomes difficult for us to find something worthy among all this. We offer movies that are in our personal tops.
## **Scope of the project:**  
   Our team can complete this project completely and fulfill all the goals and solve problems.
## **Type of the user-interface:**  
   We have chosen the web user-interface as it is the easiest way to connect this interface with the **Oracle** database server.
## **Programming language and database server:**  
   We will link the selected database server (**Oracle**) using the **PHP** programming language. The choice was **PHP** because in this language it is also easy to connect our Web interface and the database server.
